### Crafting a Freelance Header ✏️

Use this 1-line freelance headline format:  

**[Role] who helps [target audience] achieve [specific outcome] in [timeframe]**  

**Examples from the workshop:**  

- *Network Engineer who helps small-to-medium businesses validate and deploy resilient, low-downtime network architectures under one week.*  
- *Network Trainer who helps 30-student cohorts achieve an 80% MTCNA pass rate in a 2-day intensive bootcamp.*

### Personal Notes & Insights 💡

- **Work style**:  
  - Introverts → invest in a cozy workspace  
  - Extroverts (like Kak Naufal) → work in cafes and meet friends  
- **Portfolio proof** is key – dummy projects are fine to demonstrate skills  
- **Framing & branding**: be result-oriented, quantify achievements  
- **Specialization matters**: pick your expertise and refine continuously  
- **Manifest**, **Aone Schools**, **Algonova** – words/concepts to note

Remote work is **not just about flexibility**. It’s about strategic preparation, continuous learning, and measurable results. By following this framework, Gen Z freelancers can confidently navigate the global remote work landscape.
