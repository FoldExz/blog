FOTOYU is a Privacy Nightmare  
How a photo sharing app is rapidly becoming a privacy nightmare, invading public places in Jakarta. 

## So, what happened?
Recently, there have been viral cases of extortion happening in public spaces like GBK (Gelora Bung Karno) and Tebet Eco Park
People bringin personal cameras for casual photos are often pressured to join unoficial paid photography groups posing as "official" park developers
But less disscussed is that many of them are leveraging a platform called FOTOYU, a supposedly "smart" app that turns jakarta's runners into a facially tagged subject in a sprawling marketplace of images

## To put it simply. How does the app works?
1. You download the app and are required to scan your face using your phone camera, this facial data is stored and allegedly encrypted (it's still accessible to FOTOYU high-level engineers)
2. You also must keep GPS/location tracking on at all times
3. When a photo of you is taken in public (even by strangers), the app uses AI facial recognition to automatically detect if you appear in that photo
4. If you're in it, the app will match the photo to your profile. you can then claim, buy, or sell that photo via the platform
5. Once a photo is sold, the copyright is transferred to the buyer. If the buyer doesn't pay, it stays in FOTOYU's system watermarked
6. Users can earn income by uploading and tagging stranggers who happen to be in their public photos turning your face into a commodity

## Collects a massive amount of personal data
The app alarmingly requires biometric facial data for facial recognition and constantly tracks users' real-time GPS location and movement history.
To comply with account verification, users must also proceed with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes and submit their personal info for verification
A survey from Regula saidthat 49% of business had encountered fraud that bypassed KYC through using deepfakes, so what makes you think a photo app would be more secure?

## Encryption?
While FOTOYU boasts about its use of encryption, they claim that a few of its top engineers can still access the data. 
Despite boasting about its AI privacy capabilities, FOTOYU does not even employ the most basic concept of zero-trust security, especially for data as valuable as your biometrics.
Historically, several data leaks can occur because privileged user credentials, like those for AWS account, were leaked and used to extract data from encrypted S3 buckets.

## The consent comes later....
Instead of asking for permission before a photo is taken, the app allows random "photographers" to snap pictures of people in public & list them for sale.
This setup rewards "photographers" for uploading photos os strangers without consent, the so-called "consent" only refers to the choice to buy the photo, not to having it taken.
And despite boasting privacy and only collecting data for vertification, FOTOYU admits that it also gives your data to "trusted third parties", so your privacy has already been breached the moment the shutter clicked and the file got stored on FOTOYU's servers.

## What about minors?
Fotoyu allows users under 17 to register using only a selfie with a supposed parent or guardian, but there's no real system to verify whether the adult in the photo is actually a legal guardian.
This creates a dangerous loophole where children's biometric and location data can be collected, stored, and potentially misused all under the guise of a weak verification process.

## An invasion of public spaces
Street photography is a genre focused on chance encounters in public spaces, but it's different when people photograph individuals without consent, sell those images, and store that data for Al training.
The FOTOYU debate has also exposed the hostility in photography communities, where people gatekeep certain areas and often harass anyone using a camera in public, even for personal use.
Some of the photos taken & uploaded are also shot in certain ways and angle that can also be considered as sexual harassment.

## What can be done?
On a personal level, we can speak up. Don't stay silent when someone tries to take your photo without consent. Call it out, and don't normalize this behavior.
But the responsibility shouldn't fall on individuals alone. Local authorities, especially city governments and park especially administrators, must step in.
Instead of supporting platforms that profit from stealth photography, why not buildsystems that actually connect photographers and users in advance?
This practice is more commonly enacted in countries with high tourism such as China and Japan.

So Murzfam, what do you think of FOTOYU
Do you think an app like this is appropriate? have you ever encountered photographers like this?
