Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Ihsanta Zaki**, a tech enthusiast passionate about networking, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies.  

Currently, I'm diving deep into **Fortigate** to strengthen my network security skills and preparing for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SA-A)** certification to expand my cloud expertise.  

I love exploring new technologies, building projects, and sharing what I learn with the community. My journey combines hands-on experience, continuous learning, and a curiosity-driven approach to solve real-world challenges.  

When I'm not coding or configuring networks, you can find me reading tech blogs, experimenting with new tools, or exploring creative ways to combine networking and cloud solutions.  

This blog is my space to **share insights, tutorials, and personal experiences** on networking, remote work, and cloud technologies. All aimed at helping others grow while documenting my own learning journey.  

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/foldexz/) or check out my projects here. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸš€
