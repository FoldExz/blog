## Overview

On September 11, 2025, I had the opportunity to attend the seminar **"Strengthening Cloud Operations with Smart Security and Protection"** held at Sheraton Hotel, Surabaya. The program, scheduled from 09:00 to 17:00. Featured several vendors and speakers, including representatives from Mastersystem Infotama, AWS, Fortinet, Infoblox, and Veeam. I arrived at 12:30 due to an unexpected class obligation.

Although I missed the morning sessions, the afternoon offered practical demonstrations and vendor-led discussions aimed at IT managers, security leads, and infrastructure teams.

## Speakers & notable attendees

- **Hendrian Rajitama** â€” IT Services Assistant Manager, 13 years experience at Gudang Garam TBK; focus: security, ISO/IEC, NSE, Prince2, ITIL. (LinkedIn-certified skills noted.)
- **Donny Christian** â€” IT Infra & Security Manager, ~20 years experience at PT. Insera Sena; focus: security, Fortinet, cloud.
- **Budi Hertantu** â€” IT Manager, ~17 years experience at PT. Sadhana.
- **Mastersystem Infotama** (presenter) â€” AWS Q Developer and Fortinet session delivered by a Mastersystem staff member.
- **Reddy Wibisono** â€” Host & branch manager MSI Surabaya; graciously allowed me to attend the seminar as a student.

## AWS Q Developer

A Mastersystem Infotama engineer demonstrated **AWS Q Developer**, a developer-focused tool designed to assist engineers directly inside development environments. Key points from the session:

- **Use cases:** AWS Q Developer acts like a developer assistant â€” available via the console, CLI, and as an extension for code editors (e.g., VS Code).
- **Advantages:** The presenter argued this has integration benefits for AWS-centric workflows and can be installed in local editors as an extension, offering context-aware assistance without copy-pasting. Compared to general-purpose models (ChatGPT, Gemini), the value proposition is tighter integration with AWS resources and workflows.
- **Limitations:** During Q&A, it was clarified that AWS Q Developer currently **does not provide instance-level monitoring of running EC2 instances** or full infrastructure monitoring â€” its scope is primarily developer assistance. The presenter noted that monitoring and observability are handled better by other AWS services.
- **Offer:** Mastersystem offered to help attendees install the free version of the extension in their code editors.

## Fortinet

The Fortinet presentation covered core product capabilities and the importance of network-level defenses:

- **Firewall & prevention:** Firewalls remain the first line of defense against attackers and malware. Fortinetâ€™s portfolio includes next-gen firewalls, centralized management for data centers, and specialized modules for detection and response.
- **Product ecosystem:** Presenter introduced FortiGuard (threat intelligence), FortiAnalyzer (analysis), FortiEDR (endpoint detection & response), FortiDLP (data loss prevention), and other modules that form a layered security posture.
- **Network topology:** Emphasis on centralized management for data center deployments (NSFGW at DC) and security operations (Security Operations, SASE, etc.).
- **Market position:** Fortinetâ€™s security offerings were positioned highly in industry rankings and compared with vendors such as Palo Alto.

## Vendor panel & audience interaction

A panel with five presenters (mostly vendor representatives) followed, skewing toward product positioning and sales benefits rather than deep technical detail. The audience primarily IT managers and senior staff, asked real-world questions about case studies, integration scenarios, and vendor roadmaps. Common interests included Fortinet, Infoblox (DNS/IPAM), and Veeam (backup & recovery).

## Quiz, prizes, and closing

The event included a short quiz (Slido) with five questions. I answered three correctly and missed two that covered morning content I had missed. The organizers gave prizes to top quiz performers and early attendees, and concluded with a lucky draw and a group photo. I also received a souvenir before leaving.

## Personal takeaways & next steps ðŸ’¡

1. Certifications & learning path â€” I will pursue the AWS Solutions Architect certification and allocate time to learn Fortinet fundamentals (firewalls, FortiGate, FortiManager).
2. Tooling evaluation â€” AWS Q Developer looks promising for developer productivity inside AWS-centric workflows, but Iâ€™ll continue to compare it with multi-platform tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to evaluate trade-offs (integration vs. monitoring capabilities).
3. Networking & opportunities â€” The event was a good chance to meet security and infra managers from several enterprises and vendors, useful contacts for future collaboration.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Pak Reddy Wibisono** and the Mastersystem Infotama team for kindly granting me permission to attend the seminar. As a student, I truly appreciated the opportunity to join the event. The coffee, snacks (notably the red velvet pastry), and the overall event logistics were excellent.
